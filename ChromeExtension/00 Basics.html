Chrome extensions can be generally broken up into three main parts.
A background page, 
UI pages, and 
content scripts. 

Let's talk about each one of these important components in a little more detail. First we have background pages.
A Chrome extensions can have a background page which is basically an HTML page that runs in the background. Typically, a background page 
will have some JavaScript code in it that will be used to control the capabilities of the extension when it's active from the Chrome UI. 
You can actually see a list of the background pages running from Chrome using the Chrome Task Manager as you can see here.

Background pages can either be persistent or event pages. Persistence background pages are always running in open. This can be necessary 
when you have a background page that stores some persistent state for your extensions or handles some long running process to manage a 
task. 

But, background pages can be resource hogs so they should be used carefully. Often a better approach is to use an event page which is 
only loaded when it's needed. Event pages work just like background pages, except that they don't persist themselves all the time. 
Instead, an event page is registered for a specific event which will trigger it and cause it to become active.

UI Pages:
UI pages are just HTML pages that display a UI for an extension. If you've installed any Chrome extensions, this is probably the part of 
an extension you're most familiar with because it's the most visible part. A UI page is usually displayed when a user clicks the 
extensions icon in the toolbar. Browser actions which are the Icons that appear in the toolbar can have a pop-up which is an HTML page 
that's displayed when the browser action's clicked. Option pages can also be specified to customize an extension. UI pages can even 
override default pages in the Chrome browser or be displayed dynamically by JavaScript code in the extension that opens a new tab or 
window. UI pages in an extension can access and manipulate each other by changing properties on their DOMs. UI pages can even invoke 
functions on a background page, if needed.

Content Scripts:
Content scripts are scripts that are executed when certain pages load in the browser. These scripts can be used to essentially inject 
JavaScript into a page to modify its behavior or user interface. The content script essentially becomes part of the page that was 
loaded. This means a content script is going to behave like any other script on the page. So, content scripts can't directly modify the 
DOM of the HTML pages packaged with the extension, like UI pages and background pages can. But, content scripts can send messages back 
to the parent extension to ask pages in the paired extension to modify a UI page or perform some extension-related functionality. 
Likewise, a background page or UI page can send a message to a content script to cause it to perform an action on the page it's running 
on.
