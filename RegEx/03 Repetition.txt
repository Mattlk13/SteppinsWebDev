Repetition METACHARACTERS
*  matches with  preceding item, zero or more times
+        preceding item, one or more times
?        preceding item, zero or one time




apples* matches apples, apple, applesssss
apples+ matches apples, applesssssss but notn apple
apples? matches apple and applesa but not applesssss



sometimes choosing b/w * and + is just a matter of style
\d\d\d\d* matches numbers with three digits or more
\d\d\d+ also matches numbers with three digits or more
bcos the fourth d is optional there
(=> 1st match results superset of 2nd match results)
(so obvio, I like second one as the intentions are clear!)



another use of ? ----- to check american/brit spelling
colou?r matches color or colour




QUANTIFIED Repetition:
new metacharacters { and }
{ --- start quantified repetition of preceding item
} --- end quantified repetition of preceding item

{min, max}
min and max are positive numbers
min must always be included and can be zero
max value is optional


three syntaxes possible:
1.      \d{4,8}  matches numbers with four to eight digits
2.      \d{4}    matches numbers with exactly four digits (min=max)
3.      \d{4,}   matches numbers with four or more digits (max is infinite)


Between regular repetition and quantified repetition, we have a wide range of ability to specify how many times 
something will be repeated in a pattern. There is some overlap between them.
\d{0,} ==== \d*
, if I use quantified repetition and say the minimum is zero and the maximum is infinite, it's the same thing as 
using the asterisk repetition operator, where something can occur zero, one, or more times.

\d{1,} ===== \d+
If I use one as the 
minimum and leave the maximum as infinite, it's the same as using the plus repetition operator



One of the most 
common ways that quantified repetition is used is on standardized data where numbers match a specific pattern. A 
great example of that is phone numbers. US phone numbers have three digits, then a dash, then three digits, then 
a dash, and then four digits
\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4} matches most US phone numbers

A{1, 2} matches A, AA but not AAA bonds obviously
