So Selenium started out as a ThoughtWorks project. A couple of guys at ThoughtWorks came up with this idea of creating a 
framework to do some automated testing. And this was around 2004, it was called Selenium 1 or actually it was called Selenium 
RC (remote control) but we refer to it now as Selenium 1,

And this idea was that you would have a Selenium client and you'd have Selenium server and the Selenium client would send 
commands to the server and the server would use Javascript to drive the browser. So it doesn't hook directly into any of the 
browser APIs. It pretty much sent the same Javascript to any browsers that it automated and it used that Javascript engine to 
drive the browsers. Now there was a competing technology around this time called WebDriver and WebDriver had a different 
philosophy in the automation of the browsers. It didn't use Javascript. What it did was it got as close to the mettle (assumed 
spelling), as close to the native browser API as possible so it drove the different browsers with their automation APIs. 

Well, Selenium was duplicating that functionality. These where competing technologies but the WebDriver way was a little bit 
more superior but Selenium presented a pretty good API. So what ended up happening is those two projects merged together and 
that's where we have the new Selenium or Selenium 2. So when you hear of Selenium RC that's Selenium 1. That's the first 
version and it's completely different than the new version of Selenium which now uses the same technique as WebDriver. It's 
basically merged with WebDriver. So then Selenium 2 has been in beta for quite a while but has now been released and so that's 
now the current version of Selenium and it uses that WebDriver technology.
