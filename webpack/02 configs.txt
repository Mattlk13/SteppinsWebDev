So far, we've run webpack manually specifying the location of the source file and where the bundle should be placed. A more common 
practice when working with webpack is to create configuration file.
The webpack config file is just a javascript file that you'll place at the root of your project. 

So the first thing I want to do here is inside of 0104 start I'm going to create a new folder and it's going 
to be called 'src'.(jsut for better orgnz) Now inside of source, we want to relocate the index js file right there into that source file.

we'll create our webpack config. So, the new file is going to be called webpack.config.js. And it's always called that no matter what. 
It'll always look for that file. So the next think I want to do here is we'll say module.exportS and this'll be set to an object where our 
first key is entry.

And we're going to look for the entry point where our main java script file there in the src>index.js.

//CASE1: if you want to place bundle.js in the root dir itself
module.exports = {
	entry : "./src/index.js",
	output: {
		filename: "bundle.js",
	}
}

//be careful of 'dot'... in windows you might hav eto provide entire path   


//CASE2: if you want to place bundle.js in a different directory (called "dist" here_)
const path = require('path')
module.exports = {
	entry : "./src/index.js",
	output: {
		filename: "bundle.js",
		path: path.join(__dirname, "dist")
	}
}
