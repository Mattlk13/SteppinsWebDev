 Webpack loaders can help us perform transformations on files. They can help with the loading of files and images, and webpack loaders are 
 commonly used when using different dialects of JavaScript. 
 
 For example,JSX doesn't run natively in the browser. It must be first transformed into plain JavaScript. 
 similarly You also may be using ECMAScript 6, or ECMAScripts 2016, 2017, or even 2018.nSo not all browsers support all of the newest 
 features with auto transform. So like JSX, ECMAScript is often compiled into plain JavaScript prior to being loaded into the browser. 
 
 The tool most commonly used for transformation of JSX and ES6 is Babel. 
 When we use the  babel-loader in webpack projects, we tell webpack to use Babel to perform these transformations on certain types of 
 files. JSX and ES6 go in, get transpiled, and plain JavaScript comes out.


For a full list of webpack loaders, you can checkout the official webpack documentation, which provides a multitude of options for loading 
what you need with webpack.
