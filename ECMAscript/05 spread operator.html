<!--
The spread operator does a lot of powerful things with three small dots. The spread operator can turn the elements of 
an array into arguments of a function call, or into elements of an array literal. 

If we want to add the array elements to the new array, we can use the spread operator. Instead of just using the
variable name, I'm going to have each of these variables preceded by three dots. The three dots are the spread operator.
