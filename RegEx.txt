-----------------Regular Expressions------------------

regexpal.com

grep = global regular expression
egrep = extended grep

(For Operating Systems) According to POSIX standard, 
They are two categories: Basic RegEx(BRE) and Extended RegEx(ERE)
RegExs are very much tied with UNIX systems


Perl's RegEx library is so cool and powerful that, Other programmers often say, "Boy! I wish my Lib works the way Perl did" :p
PCRE library = Perl Compatible RegEx Library
For every language, there are different RegEx Libraries! :)

Note the difference between Text Editors(Sublime) and Text Processors(Word).


MetaCharacters
--------------

. = Wildcar character = Matches any character(including spaces) except newline
eg: h.t = hot, hat, hit
h..lo  = hello heylo haalo heelo
Note: if s-mode is on, then it matches newline as well

Caution: text..txt = text1.txt text2.txt text3_txt.zip   uhoh!
You need to escape . with a backslash to avoid those errors
text.\.txt = text1.txt text2.txt

eg: /home/usr/document.txt
proper way is \/home\/usr\/document\/.txt
you need to escape the forward slashes as well to avoid errors :)


Other Special Characters:
Tabs (\t)
Newlines (\n or \r or \rn)
