Currently, we're using an html file for our entire React project. Now, this is really good for testing and getting comfortable with React, 
but here may be a point at which you want to really setup a full-fledged project. 

"create-react-app" will let you setup a React project with 
all of the tooling setup and everything you need to get started, without having to do to a bunch of setup.

sudo npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app myAppName
cd myAppName (don't forget this :p)

this is going to generate an entire React app project inside of this folder. Great!

"dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.8.5",
    "react-dom": "^16.8.5",
    "react-scripts": "2.1.8"
  }
inside the package json we have react as a dependency, we have react-dom, and  react-scripts. Now, react-scripts is just a wrapper 
around all of the tooling packages needed, like babel and webpack.
