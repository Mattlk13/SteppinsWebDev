React Router is a complete routing library for React.

React Router keeps your UI in sync with the URL. It has a simple API with powerful features like lazy code loading,
dynamic route matching, and location transition handling built right in. Make the URL your first thought, not an after-thought.


$npm install --save react-router

(in index.js)
            import React from 'react'
            import { render } from 'react-dom'
            import './stylesheets/ui.scss'
            import { App } from './components/App'
            import { Whoops404 } from './components/Whoops404'
            import { Router, Route, hashHistory } from 'react-router' //new

            window.React = React

            render( //see below
              <Router history={hashHistory}>  //hashHistory is react-router's variable
                <Route path="/" component={App}/> //home director
                <Route path="*" component={Whoops404}/> //any path except home dir since path='homedir' is already checked above
              </Router>,
              document.getElementById('react-container')
            )
//history is going to listen to the browser's address bar for any changes, and it will keep track of those changes.
//So, we're going to use hash history, because we can set it up here without having to configure a server. 

(in whoops404.js)
                  export const Whoops404 = () => //used stateless component syntax
                    <div>
                      <h1>Whoops, route not found</h1>
                    </div>
