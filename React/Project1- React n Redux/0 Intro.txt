ES6 with babel 
React Router
WebPack
npm scripts
ESLint
Mocha, React Test Utils, and Enzyme
Webstorm as editor


why redux is so popular?
1. Redux centralizes all of your application state in one store: a single centralized object graph
 this makes it easier interactions
2. Reduced boilerplate. Your top-level container(app.js) components are subscribed to the store n a very elegant way.
3. It's architecture is friendly for server rendering and react components
which is commonly referred to as isomorphic or universal js.
4. Has an immutable store => more performance
5. Hot reloading => instant viewing
6. Time-travel debugging: allows you to step forward and backward through state changes in your code
and even replay interactions
7. Small: 2Kb minified
