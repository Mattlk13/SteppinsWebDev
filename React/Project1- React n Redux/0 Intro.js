why redux is so popular?
1. Redux centralizes all of your application state in one store: a single centralized object graph
 this makes it easier interactions
2. Reduced boilerplate. Your top-level container(app.js) components are subscribed to the store n a very elegant way.
3. It's architecture is friendly for server rendering and react components
which is commonly referred to as isomorphic or universal js.
4. Has an immutable store => more performance
5. Hot reloading => instant viewing
6. Time-travel debugging: allows you to step forward and backward through state changes in your code
and even replay interactions
7. Small: 2Kb minified
