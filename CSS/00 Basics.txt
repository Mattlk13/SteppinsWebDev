In terms of syntax, CSS is not a markup language like HTML, or even a scripting language like JavaScript.

It's a style sheet language. This means that CSS consists of a collection of formatting rules which identify the elements
in the document that they should control and the properties that they wish to set. These styles are usually contained in
an external file that can control a single document or an entire website. 



p {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica;
  font-size: 1em;
}
Note the semicolons

p = selector = those elements to which the style should be applied
{} = declaration
font-family, font-size = Properties
Arial, Helvetica, 1em = values
