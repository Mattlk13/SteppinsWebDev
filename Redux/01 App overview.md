So we'll be using Redux to build the data store that manages all of this state. But when planning an application, 
we always start out with wire frames. Even if the wire frames are just sketches or whiteboard drawings, is always a 
good idea to draw out your screens and what data you want to see on those screens.

Now, looking at these wire frames, you might jump the gun and start identifying all of the objects that would e necessary
to create this application. These are the nouns, and if you've done this, it's probably because you come from an object 
oriented background. However, we're working in the functional paradigm. So we're not concerned with the nouns as much as
we are concerned with the verbs. To start planning a Redux application, you want to identify all of your actions. 
So here, looking at these wire frames, I see that we have a form. So that means that users will be able to add days.
